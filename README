This is a simple hack of the GNU grep program so that instead of using newline 
characters for the bounds of the search, it uses the ">" delimeter for a fasta file.
Because of this it is as fast as grep and has all the pitfalls.  Note that currently 
fagrep does not work with fastq files, since their syntax is more complicated (and stupid).
